One Directions, or also known as 1D, was an English-Irish pop band formed in 2010. The group included Niall Horan, Liam Payne, Louis Tomlinson, and Harry Styles. Another member, Zayn Malik, used to be part of the band until 2015 when he decided to leave the group. The band came together from performing together in a famous televised series called, The X Factor, where they signed with Simon Cowellâ€™s record label Syco Records when they finished the competition.

One Direction became one of the most popular pop bands, and the firsts to be part of US Billboard 200 and have their first four albums reach number one. They did four world tours and became the highest-grossing tour by a band in history. By 2013, they became the second highest-earning celebrities under 30 according to Forbes, earning about $75 million. By 2016, the band split since they did not renew their contracts and each of them had different projects they wanted to pursue. Everyone in the group went to becoming solo artists. However, even to this day, many people still sing to their songs and consider them one of the best bands created, just like me. </p>
